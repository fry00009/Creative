			"There are many types of monsters in this world. Monsters who will not show themselves, 
			and who cause trouble. Monsters who abduct children. Monsters who devour dreams. Monsters 
			who suck blood. And monsters who always tell lies. Lying monsters are a real nuisance, they 
			are much more cunning than other monsters. They pose as humans even though they have no 
			understanding of the human heart. They eat even though they've never experienced hunger. 
			They study even though they have no interested in academics. They seek friendship even though 
			they do not know how to love. If I were to encounter such a monster, I would likely be eaten 
			by it. Because in truth, I am that monster"
